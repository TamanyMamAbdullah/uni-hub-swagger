You are generating one module of a modular OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification for the Uni Hub platform.

You must strictly follow the architecture and rules defined in the swagger-specs.md document I provided. 
Use it as the single source of truth.

Your task now:
Generate the full OpenAPI YAML file for the module: {MODULE_NAME}

Rules:
1. Follow the folder/file structure:
   - shared.yaml (global components)
   - {MODULE_NAME}.yaml (module-specific paths + schemas)

2. In this module YAML:
   - Include ONLY:
       paths:
       components:
         schemas:
   - All common schemas (ErrorResponse, SuccessResponse, Pagination...) must reference:
       $ref: "../shared.yaml#/components/schemas/..."

3. Every endpoint must:
   - Use the standard response envelope:
       success, data, meta, timestamp
   - Include requestBody (if needed)
   - Include parameters (path, query)
   - Include correct status codes
   - Include examples

4. All schema fields MUST match the database structure described in swagger-specs.md 
   (derived from Prisma schema: users, posts, profiles, messages, events, etc.)

5. Do NOT include "openapi", "info", or "servers" in module files.
   Those go only in the main index.yaml root.

6. Output valid YAML only.

Deliverables:
Produce the entire {MODULE_NAME}.yaml file, ready to save directly in /swagger/modules/.
